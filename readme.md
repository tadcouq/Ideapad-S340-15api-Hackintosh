# Introduction
After crying and searching though Internet no one have try this freeking nugget run macOS, I think its will be a fun experience to try out. This hackintosh configuration is built for Lenovo Ideapad S340-15API (Ryzen). Also this is my first hackintosh project for educational purpose because all my money goes to ~~relearn calculus~~ fund the university campus rebuild, so you know it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
